- How operational delays influence overall satisfaction.  
- Where targeted interventions can deliver the greatest improvement.

## Data Preparation & Validation

Before we could interpret the story behind the numbers, the data needed structure:

- Standardized passenger attributes (gender, age, travel class, distance).  
- Removed less than 1% of records with missing critical values to avoid skewed insights.  
- Categorized age groups and flight distance for meaningful segmentation.  
- Transformed service ratings into categories (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent) for clarity.  
- Derived delay categories to see operational performance impacts.  
- Prepared metrics like overall satisfaction, % poor ratings, and worst service touchpoints.  

**Result:** a clean, consistent, and analysis-ready dataset that tells a reliable story.

Passenger satisfaction tells a clear story, **most passengers are unhappy, and the reasons aren’t random.**  

1. **Service quality drives dissatisfaction far more than delays**  
   - Even flights that arrive on time see over **50% dissatisfaction**.  
   - The main pain points are **digital touchpoints**: clunky online booking and unreliable in-flight WiFi. Together, they account for **roughly half of all dissatisfaction**.  
   - Operational delays matter, but only explain **10–15%** of negative sentiment.

2. **Pre-flight and in-flight experiences are critical**  
   - Friction before boarding shapes perception. Poor online booking frustrates first-time flyers and short-haul travelers the most.  
   - Onboard, WiFi failures and limited entertainment reinforce negative experiences.  
   - Post-flight issues like baggage handling have a relatively minor effect on overall satisfaction.

3. **Demographics and flight type influence perception**  
   - Teens and first-time passengers are most sensitive to poor service.  
   - Business travelers are more forgiving, while personal travelers are harder to please, especially on short-haul routes.  

4. **Target areas for maximum impact**  
   - Short-haul flights, first-time flyers, and younger passengers represent the segments where improvements will yield the largest satisfaction gains.  
   - Investing in digital service fixes will move the needle far more than focusing solely on operational punctuality.

**Bottom line:** Fixing **digital touchpoints**, online booking, WiFi, and entertainment will deliver the biggest impact. Delays matter, but only when extreme. Service quality is king.

## Summary

- Only **43% of passengers are satisfied**, dissatisfaction is the default experience.  
- **Digital services and pre/in-flight touchpoints** are the dominant drivers of unhappiness.  
- Operational delays amplify dissatisfaction but aren’t the main problem.  
- Targeted improvements for high-risk passengers and short-haul flights will deliver the best ROI.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhance Online Booking & Pre-Flight Experience**  
   - Simplify the booking process, improve mobile usability, and provide clear support prompts.  

2. **Upgrade In-Flight WiFi & Entertainment**  
   - Improve reliability and speed, expand entertainment options, and communicate service availability clearly.  

3. **Target High-Risk Passenger Segments**  
   - Personalize support for teens, first-time flyers, and male passengers; consider loyalty engagement initiatives.  

4. **Prioritize Short-Haul Flights for Quick Wins**  
   - Focus on simplified online check-in and onboard WiFi fixes on short routes where dissatisfaction is highest.  

5. **Monitor & Mitigate Arrival Delays**  
   - Continue operational improvements and communicate proactively during delays. Extreme delays (>90 min) still trigger high dissatisfaction.  

6. **Implement Service Quality KPIs & Continuous Feedback**  
   - Real-time dashboards tracking WiFi, entertainment, and booking experience allow operational teams to respond quickly and measure improvement.
